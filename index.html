		<div class="about-me">
			<div>
				<p>After graduating high school I went to Minnesota State University to study Civil Engineering.
				I thought that was what I wanted to do but after a few years I realized I was not happy with this field.
					I then dropped out of college and was kind of lost for about a year.</p>
				<p>My cousin who is a software engineer showed me what he does in his field of work and I instantly knew
					that i wanted to be in this industry. Will the help of my cousin I am now a student at Thinkful
					and I am eager to learn all I can to become a developer.</p>
